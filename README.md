# Person-tracking
Assign Unique IDs: The aim is to assign unique IDs to persons and track them throughout the video.
Track Re-entries: The proposed method should be able to track the person if he/she goes out and re-enters the frame. This includes multiple children and adults.
Assign New IDs: Assign a new ID to a person entering the frame for the first time.
Post-Occlusion Tracking: Re-track the person and assign the correct ID within the video duration, post-occlusion, or partial visibility.
